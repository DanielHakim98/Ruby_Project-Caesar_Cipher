# Ruby_Project-Caesar_Cipher
* This is going to be my first project of coding using Ruby programming.
* I have done Caesar_Cipher using Javascript. Now it's time to replicate the project using Ruby.

* Works well except for large negative number.
* Code can be simplified more but I have no idea for now.

* I finally found the cause of the error of negative number. It's because on the line 41 of the code, the there is typo on the 'code_smol', and the typo is I forgot to include the 'c' in the 'code_smol'.
